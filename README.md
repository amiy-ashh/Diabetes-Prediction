# Diabetes-Prediction
A machine learning project using the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets to predict disease progression based on medical measurements.

##Overview

This project uses a linear regression (or other ML model) to predict a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, based on 10 physiological variables.
The dataset is built into scikit-learn, making it easy to load and experiment with. The goal is to build and evaluate a predictive model.
